## When to Use

- Adding/editing a **screen** or **route** in `apps/mobile`.
- Wiring **data fetching** (TanStack Query + `@cuadra/api-client`).
- Building **UI components** (chat bubbles, inputs, tab bar) or the **theme**.
- Adding **auth** (login, token storage).

## Critical Patterns

**1. Structure — feature-oriented; routes are thin (Obytes/Expo Router 2025).**

| Folder | Holds | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `app/` | Expo Router **routes only** | A route just re-exports a feature screen: `export { ChatScreen as default } from "@/features/aispace/chat-screen"` |
| `src/features/<f>/` | `<f>-screen.tsx`, `api.ts` (Query hooks), `use-*-store.tsx` (zustand), `components/`, **`enums.ts` · `interfaces.ts` · `types.ts`** | Feature is self-contained |
| `src/components/ui/` | Shared design-system primitives (Button, Input, Bubble…) | Promote here only when used in 2+ features |
| `src/lib/` | Infra: `api/` (client config), `auth/` (token storage), `hooks/` | Cross-cutting |
| `src/i18n/` | Translation files es/en/pt | UI strings localized (same languages as backend) |

- **Absolute imports** `@/...` (alias → `src/`); **no barrel exports** (`index.ts` breaks fast-refresh); relative imports within the same feature.
- **Keep screens lean**: composition + navigation only; sections own their state/Query hooks.
- **Types in DEDICATED files, never inline** (structure §3): `interface` for object/prop shapes,
  `enum` for closed value sets (e.g. `ChatRole`), `type` only for genuine aliases/unions. Per
  feature → `enums.ts` / `interfaces.ts` / `types.ts`; cross-feature → `src/shared/{interfaces,enums,types}`.
  Components import their props from `../interfaces`. (A types-only file is erased at build → NOT a
  barrel, so it's fast-refresh safe.) **Exception:** keep a WIRE/JSON discriminated union as a
  string-literal union (e.g. SSE `{type:"token"}`), not a nominal enum — an enum fights the values
  that arrive off the network.

**2. Styling — NativeWind + react-native-reusables + own components.**
- **NativeWind** (Tailwind for RN) via `className`; dark/light via Tailwind `dark:` + `useColorScheme()`. Brand green `#16A34A`. Tokens in `tailwind.config.js` (see `cuadra-design-system` skill).
- **react-native-reusables** as composable, unstyled bases (shadcn-style); **build our OWN components** on top for Cuadra's look (scalloped FABs, the Insights wheel, card tiles). Don't fight the library — wrap it.
- **Icons: `lucide-react-native`** (lucide.dev) — the ONLY icon set. One `<Icon name=... />` wrapper in `components/ui`.

**2b. Component-driven + refactor (HARD rule).**
- Build the screen from small, named, reusable components — never one giant screen file. If a visual block repeats (card, money tile, list row, chip, FAB), it's a component in `components/ui/` or the feature's `components/`.
- **Refactor relentlessly**: the 2nd time you copy markup, extract it. Screens = composition only. See `cuadra-design-system` for the component inventory.

**3. Data — TanStack Query over `@cuadra/api-client`.**
- Configure the generated client ONCE in `src/lib/api/` (base URL from env + auth header from the token).
- Query/mutation hooks live in `features/<f>/api.ts` and call the SDK functions (`getMetrics`, `chat`, `resume`, `devLogin`). Screens consume the hooks.

**3b. Streaming (SSE) — hand-rolled over `expo/fetch`, NOT the generated SDK.**
- The hey-api SDK can't model a token stream. For SSE endpoints (the chat `POST /aispace/chat/stream`)
  write a transport on **`expo/fetch`** (SDK-56 WinterCG fetch with real `ReadableStream` on native —
  **do NOT add `react-native-sse`**; the native `EventSource` also can't send the `Authorization`
  header). Read base URL + token via `API_BASE_URL` / `getApiAuthToken()` exported from
  `lib/api/client.ts` (the transport bypasses the SDK interceptor, so it sets its own Bearer).
- Parse `data:` frames; surface a small event union (`token`/`pending`/`done`/`error`). A hook
  (`use-chat`) owns state + drives the transport; the screen consumes the hook. (HITL confirm still
  uses the generated `resume`.)

**4. Auth — zustand store + dev-login (no external IdP yet).**
- Login screen calls `devLogin({ body: { email } })` → store `access_token` in a zustand auth store (+ secure storage for persistence) → inject as `Authorization: Bearer` in the api-client config. Root `_layout` gates `(auth)` vs `(tabs)` on token presence.
- Prod swaps dev-login for the external IdP (§E.2). Never hardcode tokens in committed code.

**5. i18n — localize UI strings (es/en/pt), consistent with the backend.**
- App copy in `src/i18n/{es,en,pt}.json`. The CHAT replies come already localized from the agent (backend handles language); the app passes a `locale` to the chat endpoints.
- **Gotcha:** send the app's CHOSEN language (`getLanguage()` from `src/i18n`), NOT the raw device
  locale (`Intl…resolvedOptions().locale`). The backend uses the client locale as the PRIMARY signal
  and only overrides on high-confidence per-message detection — so a Spanish user on an English phone
  got English replies. (See `docs/sdd/aispace-general-agent.md` §4.)
- **Language is a user PREFERENCE, not the device's.** `features/settings/use-language-store.tsx`
  (zustand, persisted via SecureStore) holds `{auto, lang}`: `auto` (default) follows
  `deviceLanguage()`, OFF pins es/en/pt. It calls i18n `setLanguage` (the whole app) and the chat
  reads `getLanguage()`. Selector lives in Config → Idioma (a Switch reveals the picker). Root
  `_layout` calls its `restore()` on mount. **Reactivity caveat:** `t()` reads a module global —
  the screen that changes language re-renders (subscribes to the store) and the chat is correct
  (reads at send), but other static copy updates only on remount/navigation. Acceptable for MVP.
- **Backend splits "workflow chrome" vs. "free reply" language** (`ui_language` vs `language` in
  `AispaceState`) — the HITL dock's confirm/cancel/prompts ALWAYS follow the app's chosen locale
  you send (never overridden by what the user typed that turn), while the agent's own free-text
  reply can still adapt to a clearly-different message language. Mobile doesn't need to do
  anything extra for this (still just send `getLanguage()`) — noted here so it's clear why the
  dock's buttons never "flip" language mid-conversation the way a reply might.

**6. Native / New-Architecture (Fabric) gotchas — learned the hard way.**
- **Reanimated `entering`/layout animations are UNRELIABLE here** (don't fire on the New
  Architecture). For per-element animation (e.g. the chat's per-word fade-in, `streaming-text.tsx`)
  use the primitives that DO work app-wide: `useSharedValue` + `useAnimatedStyle` + `withTiming`,
  kicked off in a `useEffect` on mount. Animate words as wrapping inline `<Animated.View>` (not
  nested inline `<Text>` runs). Only newly-mounted items animate (React reuses earlier ones by key).
- **NEVER wrap a `ScrollView` in `<TouchableWithoutFeedback>`** (a common keyboard-dismiss hack): it
  claims the touch responder on start and STEALS the ScrollView's vertical pan + rubber-band bounce.
  Dismiss the keyboard via the ScrollView itself: `keyboardDismissMode="interactive"` (also gives the
  iMessage drag-down-to-dismiss) + `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"`.
- **ChatGPT-style chat scroll recipe:** `alwaysBounceVertical` + `bounces` + `overScrollMode="always"`
  (elastic bounce even when content fits) · content **top-aligned** (default container; do NOT
  `justifyContent:flex-end` — that's WhatsApp, leaves a gap above) · **smart auto-follow**: track
  near-bottom in `onScroll` and only `scrollToEnd` on new/streaming content when already at the
  bottom, so scrolling up to read history isn't yanked down.
- **Selectable rows (radio/checkbox):** RN-Web does NOT map `accessibilityState={{selected/checked}}`
  → `aria-*` for `role="button"`. Use the unified RN ARIA props directly — `role="radio"` (or
  `"checkbox"` for multi-select) + `aria-checked={selected}` + `aria-label` — which map on BOTH
  native and web (and are testable). Shared `SelectableRow` (`features/settings/components/`)
  powers personality/language (radio) and currency prefs (checkbox, capped selection) — pass
  `role`/`disabled`, don't fork the component.
- **A native `GlassView`/`GlassSurface` must never auto-size to CHANGING content.** If a glass
  surface WRAPS content whose height grows (e.g. a collapsible panel opening), Fabric mis-measures
  on re-layout — the whole zone drifts/detaches from where it should be pinned, even with nothing
  else animating. Fix: make the glass an `absoluteFill` BACKGROUND (only the tint/border live
  inside it) and let a plain sibling `View` in normal RN flow size the container and anchor
  edges — same pattern the chat card and its bottom dock both use.
- **A multiline `TextInput`'s controlled `value` can "resurrect" after you clear it.** On iOS, a
  pending autocorrect/predictive-text candidate can commit on a NATIVE event that fires AFTER your
  send handler already ran `setValue("")` — a synchronous clear (state or `.clear()`) in that same
  handler doesn't reliably win the race, so the old (now autocorrected) text briefly reappears.
  Fix by intercepting the specific late event instead of racing it: remember the (lowercased) text
  you just sent, and in `onChangeText`, if the incoming text matches it case-insensitively, treat
  it as that echo and clear again — any OTHER incoming text clears the guard so real typing right
  after Send is never eaten (`features/aispace/components/chat-input-bar.tsx`).

**7. Sub-screens inside a tab (Config → detail, back via arrow OR the tab).**
- Turn the tab leaf into a NESTED STACK: `app/(tabs)/config/{_layout.tsx (Stack, headerShown:false),
  index.tsx, <detail>.tsx}`. The tab bar stays (it belongs to `(tabs)`), so the detail is reachable
  back via its own arrow (`router.back()`) OR by tapping the Config tab (pops to index). The custom
  tab bar filters routes by `name` so the `config` route still works unchanged.
- **Typed routes** (`experiments.typedRoutes`) live in gitignored `.expo/types/router.d.ts` — adding
  a route makes `router.push("/config/...")` fail `typecheck` until regenerated. Regenerate by briefly
  running Metro (`npx expo start`, wait for the path to appear in the d.ts, kill it); CI regenerates
  on build.
- **Every screen in a nested Stack MUST self-paint `<AppBackground/>`, not rely on the root layer
  showing through.** The root `contentStyle:{backgroundColor:"transparent"}` (so the ONE
  `<AppBackground/>` mounted in `theme-provider.tsx` shows through everywhere) looks fine at rest
  but breaks push/pop: `react-native-screens`' native stack never properly hides a transparent
  OUTGOING screen mid-transition, so its live content visibly ghosts/overlaps under the incoming
  screen (documented, unresolved upstream — expo/expo#33040). Add `<AppBackground/>` as the first
  child inside every new sub-screen's root `SafeAreaView` (see `features/settings/*-screen.tsx` for
  the 4 Config sub-screens that need it) — visually identical at rest, but each screen is now
  self-contained during the slide so nothing bleeds through.

## Code Examples

```tsx
// app/(tabs)/aispace.tsx — route is a thin re-export
export { ChatScreen as default } from "@/features/aispace/chat-screen";

// src/features/aispace/api.ts — Query/mutation over the SDK
import { useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { chat } from "@cuadra/api-client";
export const useSendMessage = () =>
  useMutation({ mutationFn: (vars: { message: string; thread_id?: string; locale?: string }) =>
    chat({ body: vars }).then(r => r.data!) });
```

## Commands

```bash
make openapi                          # regenerate @cuadra/api-client after backend changes
pnpm --filter @cuadra/mobile typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (run after edits — cannot run simulator headlessly)
pnpm --filter @cuadra/mobile start       # expo start (the USER runs this to see the app)
```
